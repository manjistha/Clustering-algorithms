# Clustering-algorithms
A very brief insight to Machine learning and clustering algorithms

Clustering means grouping of objects based on the information found in the data describing the objects or their relationship.
The goal is that objects in one group should be similar to each other but different from objects in another group.

K means clustering is one of the simplest algorithms which divides the entire dataset into 'k' clusters and requires two numbers:
1] k=number of clusters
2]training set[m]={x1,x2,...,xm}

My program is a very simple implementation of k-means clustering where i have randomely selected some x and y data points and have plotted
them in a scatterplot using a simple random value of k to determine the centroid.
